Oh its so funny to be seeing you after so long girl
 A                                      G#m            C#m
And by the way you look i understand that you were not impressed
 A                                G#m      C#m
But i heard you let that little friend of mine
 D                   B7sus4  B7
Take off your party dress
 A                 G#m    C#m
I'm not gonna get too sentimental
            A                G#m  C#m
Like those other sticky valentines
  A                              G#m       C#m
Cause i don't know if you were loving somebody
 D                        B7sus4  B7
I only know it isn't mine



A     E  A           B        G#m    C#m

        A                              G#m             C#m
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake
     A                     G#m      C#m
You used to hold him right in your hand
        D                      B7sus4  B7
But he took all that he could take
  A                            G#m            C#m
Sometimes i wish that i could stop you from talking
        A                 G#m            C#m
When i hear those silly things that you say
    A                   G#m              C#m
I think somebody better put out the big light
             D                           B7sus4   B7
