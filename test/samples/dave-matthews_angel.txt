                 Angel - Dave Matthews Band
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tabbed by: Kotie A.
Email: LastRockShow@hotmail.com

Tuning: Tune down 1/2 step (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, Eb)

I love this song, the band itself. I thought I'd try tabbing this. Another thing,
Dave uses different picking, he doesn't just do a plain chord, so it will sound
different.

Intro:
------------------------------------------
C  F  C  F

Verse:
------------------------------------------
C
     I call you up
F
     You pick up
C
     You call my bluff
F
     On the cards of love
C
     You hold to close
F
     Your hands to your chest
C
     I can't read you eyes
F
     But I confess
G
     It's lonely far
F
     From you
C
     Even when you're right by me
G
     It's only why
F
     I wait for you
C                 F     C/E
     To take my ha - nd

Chorus:
------------------------------------------
D                        Em7   D/F#        Gm
     Why do I beg like a child for you can - dy?
D                        Em7        D/F#      Gm
     Why do I come after you like I do? I love  you
Gm         Dm/F
     Whate'er you are
E7            Gm/Bb       Gm/F   F
     I swear, you'll be my an - gel, you

Verse:
------------------------------------------
C
     I play my cards
F
     Best I can
C
     But I lose my luck
F
     When you're not here
C
     My darling heart
F
     Won't you please give in?
C
     I may be strong
F
     But I want you back again
G
     When you're not here
F
     Oh, it's hard to pretend
C
     It's all alright....again
G
     When you're not here
F
     Love, it's hard to pretend
C                   F     C/E
     It's all alright.....still

~Back To Chorus~

Verse:
------------------------------------------
C
     Watch the deck
F
     And count your cards
C
     Makes no sense
F
     That I'm always losing
C
     .....
F
     When you're gone
C
     .....
F
     .....

~Back To Chorus~

Outro:
------------------------------------------
C
     .....
F
     When you're gone
C
     .....
F
     .....
